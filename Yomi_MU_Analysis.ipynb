        "**Yomi** is a 2-players card game by *David Sirlin* in which both players choose a character to play between 20 pre-made character decks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although considered a very-well balanced game, when two characters face one has inevitably the advantage over the other (considering it \"balanced\" means that few to no matchups give a large advantage to one player). This is called a positive Match-Up, shortened to MU, while being a negative MU for the other character.\n",
        "\n",
        "As such, some characters may be better overall, and others might be worse overall. Determining the value of each character lets us create what's called a Tier List, which is important for this kind of games since it lets people know which characters are more relevant and thus which characters you should know how to play (or play against) as better as possible."
